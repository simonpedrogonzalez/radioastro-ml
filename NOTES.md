[NOTES]
The amplitude adn tropospheric thing should allow to change the data in a noticieable way, make some plots of the visibilities. to check if this would be good for corrupting the data.

[NOTES]
Look at the code of setgain, to see how setnoise actually works. Setgains, see what the code actually does. Chekc if one antenna can be fiddled with (just one antenna).

set how the setgain does aactually work.

Going to write the grant again
make some edits

including the corrections.

due 23rd january at 5pm. to check



TODOS:

0. Fractional residual plot.
1. Noise shouldnt have any pattern, investigate.
2. Make visibility plots for all functions
3. Study how setgains, setrop actually works
4. [LATER] check grant 23rd 5pm
5. Check no-op but performing setgain with values that should make it to no-op.


By antenna, colored separate corruption plotms
change of frac residuals

all the baselines to that antenna
if removed
test removing the antenna


create the abstract early
the longer we wait the most info but it doesnt need to be perfect

cosmic ai due tomorrow,

real examples of data corruption

4 images pair bandpass cal

show a pannel with the last image
small thumbnails with a row
fractional residual plots
fractional residuals for hurricane

just the image, no RA decl, and

4/5 images

think what highlights the work
pick 4 or 5 of them


due 5pm tomorow

wednesday 2 pm
next week plane 4:20 next monday
